## Utilizing the LWJGL for 2D gaming

This project aims to set up an environment for 2D isometric games, based on the side scrolling example by [GamesWithGabe](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtrSb4XxIVbp8AKuEAlwNXDxr99e3woGE). It is primarily a proof of concept, and is not currently intended for any major release.

## Installation Instructions

There's no current packaging process

## Development Setup

JAVA_HOME needs to be declared in environment variables for gradle scripts

Everything else should work in IDE of choice

## Contributor expectations

Not expecting contributors, but feel free to open an issue

## TODOs

- [ ] Derive from the source code - Currently leaning almost exclusively on a LWJGL series by [GamesWithGabe](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtrSb4XxIVbp8AKuEAlwNXDxr99e3woGE) to stand up the project
- [ ] Add information to GitHub
